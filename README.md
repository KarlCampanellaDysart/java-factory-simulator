# java-factory-simulator

This was an assignment for my Principles of Software Development class. I had to make a simulation of a factory with a the elements of a factory (workers, tools, resources). It was animated so that I was visually able to see a worker use a tool with a resource. The time simulations took to complete was the time for a job to be finished. Jobs were submitted over the network from a form. A text file was serialized and sent to the main application where it was pending until I accepted the order. Orders could be stacked and they started once the previous one was done. This application demonstrated my knowledge of multithreaded programing. Additionally, there was a bit of AI implemented in the movement of the workers to their desired resource/tool/work station. This was built in Java using the swing library for the GUI.
